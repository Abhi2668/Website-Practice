            Begin by preparing the sauce in a saucepan. Add milk and heavy cream and reduce it to a healthy consistency. To this add cooked chicken to your preference and add a dash of salt and basil leaves.
            Now begin preparing pasta in separate pan. Use the shape of your choice and cook to your preference. Add the sauce once a little amount of water remains in the pan.
